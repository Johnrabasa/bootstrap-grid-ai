# Bootstrap Grid AI

This repo contains a single `AI` (Adobe Illustrator) file
which has columns and gutters representing the exact 1170 px 
grid that Bootstrap 3.0.3 uses.

There are 5 separate layers, which provide a layout for 12 cols,
6 cols, 4 cols, 3 cols and 2 cols for a fixed width of 1170px.

## Future Enhancements

Over the next week or two, I will add artboards for other mobile
devices and screen sizes, namely `@media (min-width: 768px) `, 
`@media (min-width: 992px)` and `@media (min-width: 1200px)`.
