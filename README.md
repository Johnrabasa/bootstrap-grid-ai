# Bootstrap Grid AI

This repo contains a single `AI` (Adobe Illustrator) file
which has columns and gutters representing the exact 1170 px 
grid that Bootstrap 3.0.3 uses.

## Future Enhancements

Over the next week or two, I will add artboards for other mobile
devices and screen sizes, namely `@media (min-width: 768px) `, 
`@media (min-width: 992px)` and `@media (min-width: 1200px)`.
